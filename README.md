# MultiThreading-Styles
This project contains different benchmarks and programs implemented with different threading styles.

None of these programs except "ImageBlurExplPowerM" are designed to run with power monitor automatically. In order for them to be able to use power monitor, a "networkHandler" class, like the one inside "ImageBlurExplPowerM" should be added to them. Also, some small adjustments are to be made which I can help with.
